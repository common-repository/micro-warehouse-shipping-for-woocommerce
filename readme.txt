== Description ==

This is an add-on plugin for the Small Package Quotes and LTL Freight Quotes plugins (which are available for many transportation providers) published by Eniture Technology. This add-on plugin will only work with quoting plugins published by Eniture Technology that are installed and activated on your website.

The plugin allows for individual products to be made available for quoting purposes from more than one (but not all) dropship locations. This is a hybrid of the “warehouse” and “dropship” ship-from locations normally found in the Eniture Technology quoting plugins. When an item in the shopping cart is assigned to more than one dropship location, the one closest to the ship-to address is used as the ship-from location for quoting purposes.
